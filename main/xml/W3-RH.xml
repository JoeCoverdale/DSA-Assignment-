            <problems> Problems include: Relationships between tables, data types and tried to implement a weather table </problems>
            
            <solutions> Firstly: weather table proved to be useless as we shouldn't need to stored any weather data from the past. Secondly: data types were addressed by researching and testing. Thirdly: Our relationships were tested on paper until we found an efficent relationship diagram </solutions>

            We have 4 main PHP files (not including our indiviudal tasks added) that gets data from the server/api and produces selective data
            from our query. 
            <description>PHP was used to access the project's database, query the data needed and export to javascript variables.
            We have 4 main PHP files (not including our indiviudal tasks added) that gets data from the server/api and produces selective data
            from our query. 
            The config.php file handles the connection to the database and holds api keys in PHP variables.
            The getLocation.php file loops through rows of our database table 'geo_location' - fetching all latitude and logitude coordinates and
            assigning them each a variable name with an index from 0-15. Allowing us to easily reference coordinates used for map placement/markers in js.
            The getPlacesOfInterest.php file does the same as the getLocation.php file, but instead it loops through our database table 'places_of_interest'
            and concatenates a string of POI data to a variable with an index of 0-14. This data is used to produce infowindow content.

            <problems> In line with the requirements of the project, a server-side language had to be utilised that could run on the back end of our project.</problems>
            
            <solutions> To fulfill the requirements of the project, our server-side language of choice was PHP. Using PHP we were able communicate with our database, 
            by executing MYSQL queries, to return results from APIs, and to format data to be returned to the front end as required. </solutions>

    <overall_comments> The group found this an interesting and useful excercise that taught us the core technologies behind web development. Aside from 
        learning languages; HTML5, XML, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL in the context of developing a website, we also gained valuable 
        skills working with APIs and web developement tools/kits.  </overall_comments>
